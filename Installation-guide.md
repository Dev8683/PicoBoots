## 0. Word of caution

There are a lot of botched installation pictures all over the internet. It became ridiculous at that point. Please don't attempt the installation until you have enough soldering experience. You won't be able to magically do it after watching one video on YouTube. It requires actual practice! Try on some scrap electronics first.

## 1. Prerequisites

You obviously need a soldering iron, soldering wire, flux and 26 AWG and 28 AWG wires. I recommend T12 soldering station ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3bgBbOW), [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEiTBWJ)).

* Raspberry Pi Pico ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3JbIsMw), [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DkGpnTv))
* SD Gecko/WiiSD ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3cPCEMs), [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dm43n6J)) or SD2SP2 ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/3I1cCSl), [AliExpress](https://amzn.to/3PNamBe))
* FAT32 or exFAT formatted SD card

## 2. Flashing Raspberry Pi Pico board

Go to [the latest release page](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot/releases/latest) and download `picoboot.uf2` file. Now connect Raspberry Pi Pico board to your computer while holding `BOOTSEL` button pressed. If it's been done correctly you'll see `RPI-RP2` mass storage device show up. Drag and drop `picoboot.uf2` file to that device. It'll automatically eject and green LED will light up if it was programmed correctly. Unplug USB cable from Pico and proceed with hardware installation.

## 3. Preparing SD card

Format your SD card to FAT32 or exFAT. Download the latest Swiss release from [here](https://github.com/emukidid/swiss-gc/releases/latest) and grab `swiss_rXXXX.dol` file, rename it to `ipl.dol` and copy to the root of your SD card.

## 4. Hardware installation

‚ùó Wire length and diameter plays a huge role! Keep the wires as short as possible, 10 cm (~4 inches) is a sweet spot. Anything longer can result in no video issue and don't work reliably. Use high quality 28 AWG cables for data lines and 26 AWG for 3.3V and GND.

‚ùó It's very easy to overheat GC motherboard and rip pads. It happens if you hold your soldering iron for too long. Using flux makes soldering much easier. If you are using stranded wire, twist the ends first and then tin with solder. Before soldering to the motherboard, use some flux and leaded solder on the points you'll be soldering wires to in a moment.
